## Evaluating Risk-Adjusted Returns in a Conservative Client Portfolio

This project analyzes the performance of a conservative-to-moderate investment portfolio, designed to reflect how a real client’s assets might be allocated across diversified exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The goal of the analysis is to evaluate how different asset mixes perform in terms of returns, volatility, and risk-adjusted performance, rather than focusing on returns alone.

The portfolio includes a blend of equity-focused and balanced funds — XEC, XBAL, VEQ, and XEF — chosen to represent varying levels of geographic exposure, asset diversification, and risk tolerance. By examining these funds together, the analysis mirrors the type of evaluation an investment analyst or advisor might conduct when assessing portfolio suitability for a risk-averse client seeking steady growth.

Rather than relying on a single performance metric, the project evaluates returns through both absolute performance (total gains over a six-month period) and risk-adjusted performance, using the Sharpe Ratio to account for volatility. This approach highlights the trade-offs between higher returns and increased risk, providing a more realistic framework for portfolio decision-making.

### Key Insights

- VEQ delivered the strongest risk-adjusted performance, achieving the highest Sharpe Ratio (2.885), indicating that it generated the most return per unit of risk among the funds analyzed.

- XBAL demonstrated strong stability with competitive risk-adjusted returns. With a Sharpe Ratio of 2.352, it performed well relative to its conservative, balanced structure, reinforcing its role as a stabilizing core holding.

- XEC achieved the highest absolute return over the six-month period (19.99%), but with lower risk-adjusted efficiency compared to VEQ and XBAL, reflecting greater volatility associated with emerging market exposure.

- XEF showed the lowest performance on both metrics, posting the lowest Sharpe Ratio (1.555) and the smallest overall gain (8.45%), suggesting weaker compensation for risk during the analysis period.

- Higher returns did not always correspond to better risk-adjusted outcomes. While XEC led in total gains, VEQ and XBAL provided more consistent performance relative to volatility, highlighting the importance of evaluating risk alongside returns.

### Recommendations & Practical Takeaways

- **Anchor conservative portfolios with strong risk-adjusted performers**
Funds like VEQ and XBAL are well-suited as foundational holdings for conservative or moderate-risk portfolios, as they offer efficient return generation without excessive volatility.

- **Use higher-volatility funds selectively**
While XEC can enhance returns during favourable market conditions, its lower Sharpe Ratio suggests it should be used as a complementary allocation rather than a core holding for risk-averse clients.
